This is a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper
["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832). The project also uses ideas from the paper ["Deep Face Recognition"](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf) from the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at Oxford.

## Training data
The [CASIA-WebFace](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html) dataset has been used for training. This training set consists of total of 453 images over 10 575 identities after face detection. Some performance improvement has been seen if the dataset has been filtered before training. Some more information about how this was done will come later.
The best performing model has been trained on the [VGGFace2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/) dataset consisting of ~3.3M faces and ~9000 classes.

## Pre-processing

### Face alignment using MTCNN
One problem with the above approach seems to be that the Dlib face detector misses some of the hard examples (partial occlusion, silhouettes, etc). This makes the training set too "easy" which causes the model to perform worse on other benchmarks.
To solve this, other face landmark detectors has been tested. One face landmark detector that has proven to work very well in this setting is the
Multi-task CNN. A Matlab/Caffe implementation can be found here and this has been used for face alignment with very good results. A Python/Tensorflow implementation of MTCNN can be found here. This implementation does not give identical results to the Matlab/Caffe implementation but the performance is very similar.
